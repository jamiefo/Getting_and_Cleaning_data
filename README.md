This Project is to create a Tidy dataset from the 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data provided to us.

My program completes the following steps

1. Brings in Data including X_train/test, Y_train/test, Subject and Activity Labels
2. Add column names to the X_train/X_test datasets
3. Merge on Activity Labels to Y_train/Y_test, stack these two datasets
4. Merge Subject values to X_train/X_test, Stack them
5. Merge combined X and Y dataframs
6. Extract Measurements of Mean and Standard Deviation for Each Measurement
7. Create a second dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
8. Appropriately label the above dataset with the suffice _mean to each variable
9. Write out the final dataframe
